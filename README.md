# Building-mySQL-Data-base:
## This project consists in creating a Data-base in mySQL. 

For this project I have 7 .csv files that I need to create a Data-base in mySQL with. 
The files are:
_actor.csv
category.csv
film.csv
inventory.csv
language.csv
old_HDD.csv
rental.csv_
You can find them in the folder *data*.


**Step 1**: Clean the .csv files. See **notebooks** folder for this.
**Step 2**: Create the Data-base. See **creation.sql** in **mySQL** folder for this. 
**Step 3**: Add the data to the Data-base. See **seeding.sql** in **mySQL** folder for this.
**Step 4**: Use queries to make observations about the Data-base. See **queries.sql** in **mySQL** folder for this. 

##Notes:
I did not use file language.csv since all the films where in English so there was no need to specify the language.
